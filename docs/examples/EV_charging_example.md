# EV Charging Example


Haven't decided what this example will be yet. I'm tempted to pull in the HELICS EV charging example and implement it with the CST federate class.

This example needs to generate data that can be used in the post-processing example.

Needs to have multiple scenarios.

Demonstrate use of pgadmin to verify data is in database (rather than making graphs as in the HELICS example).
