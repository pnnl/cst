Code Reference
==============

TSO Case Data
-------------

The TSO schema was based on the MATPOWER formats for the network and generator cost data, supplemented with TESP data.
Code in *tso_PYPOWER.py and tso_psst.py* reads this data from a JSON file.

.. jsonschema:: tso_schema.json

src Directory Structure
-----------------------

This list shows **directories** and *Python files* under the **tesp/src** repository. On GitHub, each README contains a list of other files.

- **archive**

  - **pypower**; legacy files to patch PYPOWER; we have been able to incorporate these patches into the main PYPOWER distribution.

- **comms_metrics**; a Power Distribution System Model Analysis tool not yet public though pypi. Not only can it perform metric calculations, it also has the ability to plot the models as a network and parse different file formats as pre-processing for the data analysis.
- **energyplus**; C++ code to build a simple interface agent for EnergyPlus; this is part of the TESP distribution and used in the te30, sgip1 and energyplus examples.
- **gridlabd**; legacy files for the house populations and feeder growth model; these features are mostly subsumed into tesp_support
- **jupyter**; a prototype Jupyter notebook used for post-processing demonstrations and training
- **matpower**

  - **ubuntu**; legacy code that wraps MATPOWER for TESP, but only on Ubuntu. We now use PYPOWER. In 2017, the wrapping process was very difficult on Mac OS X, and unsuccessful on Windows using free compilers.
